What can I say? This was really hard as a first project. I am sitting here trying to finish up what I can for my review, which I will have in less than 3 hours. I have been working non-stop for days, and in the last 48 hours literally non-stop, only a few hours of sleep. 

My project is not complete however I am going to do my best to walk through it and get through this assessment. A lot of my time has been spent reviewing notes and going back to labs to try to accomplish a task. I think using time more wisely would have been helpful for me. 

Organizing and noting everything I wanted to do for my project in a lot more detail would have also been helpful. I noted multiple errors and tried not to spend hours on them and come back at another time, but some I had to spend time on to move forward. Or so I thought. 

Where I am really stuck is scraping to the next level. I watched videos, reviewed notes, asked some questions, yet it still was not clicking for me. 

Honestly, the most rewarding part was seeing my code work, but is unrewarding is not fully being able to explain how it works or how I achieved it. I was able to get gem and cli to work, but some parts are not. 
I take this as a major lesson learned, even though I really tried and spent so many hours working, yet still struggling up to this point. I am feeling down about having my assessment with uncomplete work, but also motivated to still learn what is needed. I know this is the first of many with projects, but this will only drive me to go harder.
